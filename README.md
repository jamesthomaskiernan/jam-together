## About
This project is a website which allows musicians to find and schedule jam sessions with each other. Jam sessions are casual events where musicians can get together and play whatever kind of music they want. Jam sessions are different from rehearsals in that they donâ€™t always take place at the same location, time, or have the same people. This website allows musicians to create their own profile, specify their instrument, and find/host local jam sessions.
